## Full-Custom ASIC Design

In Full-Custom ASIC, all the logic cells, circuits, and layouts are designed specifically for that particular ASIC from the ground up. It is chosen **only if**:

- Existing libraries are not fast enough, or
- The logic cells are not small, or
- The power consumption is high and needs to be reduced.

### Advantages
- Delivers the **highest possible performance** at the **smallest possible die size**.

> **Die Size**: The physical dimensions, specifically the surface area, of a single, completed integrated circuit (IC) on a semiconductor wafer. It's essentially the size of the "chip" itself before it's packaged for use.

### Disadvantages
- High performance and small size come at the cost of:
  - Increased design time
  - Complex design process
  - Higher overall cost of the IC

### Examples
- Microprocessors  
- Memories  
- Analog Processors  
- Analog/Digital Communication devices  
- Sensors, Transducers  
- High-voltage ICs for automobiles
